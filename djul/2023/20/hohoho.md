GOD FUCKING DAMMIT

there is very little documentation/indication that
1) hashcat with -O has a password length limit (a lowish one, without it's 256, or so i've found)
2) EVEN FUCKING combine AND combine3 HAVE LENGTH LIMITS (or something like that, either way they
don't produce all the passwords they should naively)

3) **EVEN** _FUCKING_ ***GODDAMNED*** `hashcat -a1 <dict1> <dict2>` HAS SOME SIMILAR LIMITS
WHY THE FUCK JESUS FUCK
I JUST REWROTE IT IN RUST FUCK IT
