# AoC 2025

Misc notes on the day's problem and how to improve perhaps?

## day 1

straightforward, in p2 took a bit too long to figure out the proper condition for
whether a partial turn crosses 0 or not.

### improvements
write down more clearly the logic of when something should turn?
it's fine to write long ass boolean expressions as long as i'm sure they work,
then i can see if i can clean them up later.

## day 2
a little anal, p2 required some rewriting, i went back-and-forth on
whether i'd do iteration on number of digits or iteration on repeats,
but the first idea (repeats) was right, then i forgot the intuitive
reason why which lead to some debugging

also again some memery around boolean checks which maybe could have been avoided by
writing it out in full in the dumbest possible way

### improvements
write down a comment clarifying why i decided one thing?
but it was intuitive rather than thought through so idk, tricky.
